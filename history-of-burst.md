Burst Team
==========

After the original developer of Burst disappeared a community quickly formed under the name Burst Team in August of 2015. Development of the wallet software continued in a fork at Github [17]. A website and a forum were created at [burst-team.us](https://www.burst-team.us).

Burstnation
===========

Because of differences within Burst Team, several members founded [Burstnation](https://www.burstnation.com) [18] by the end of 2016 . The differences among both fractions of the community continued for a long time until leading Burstnation members announced their retirement from the Burst community in the aftermath of the Dymaxion release (see below).

Spam Attack and Network Forks
=============================

On July 22nd of 2017 an attacker spammed the Burst network with messages, causing wallets to crash and splitting the network into multiple forks [19]. The network remained unstable for several days. As a result the Poloniex exchange froze the coin and disabled deposits and withdrawls . By August 10th the network was stable again and Poloniex reactived Burst deposits and withdrawls .

Formation of the PoC Consortium
===============================

In the aftermath of the spam attack a group of Burst enthusiasts formed the [Proof-of-Capacity Consortium (PoCC)](poc-consortium.md). The original announcement of the group was posted on the third anniversary of the Burst blockchain on August 11th of 2017[20]. Initial activities of the group included improving the wallet software and providing a reliable block explorer.

Release of the Dymaxion White Paper
===================================

On December, 27th 2017 the PoC Consortium released a white paper titled “[The Burst Dymaxion](https://dymaxion.burst.cryptoguru.org/The-Burst-Dymaxion-1.00.pdf)” This white paper describes a proposed layer to the Burst blockchain capable of sustaining the total global load of non-cash transactions. The implementation of The Dymaxion by the PoC Consortium is ongoing.
