The internal AT (automated transaction) and escrow account is used for execution of automated transactions and escrow payments, as an internal intermediary party i.e. it cannot be the sender or recipient of a transaction.

The account information is visible when it is accessed through the Block Explorer, using the following link: <https://explorer.burstcoin.network/?action=account&account=0> . The account has the numeric ID 0 and a Burst address BURST-2222-2222-2222-22222.

The account information shows a number of historic transactions, ordinary and multi-outs, which are indicative of the transactions executed using this account. However, the balance of the account shown in Block Explorer is a result of the Block Explorer's interpretation of the intermediary states of the account, and therefore doesn't affect the total supply of Burst.
