Introduction
------------

Burst has a big advantage that many other blockchains do not have, Burst Messages. Burst messages can be sent private and encrypted but also open for everyone to see in the blockchain. Why not use that functionality for something more meaningful than private messages?

Concept
------

To build a concept with syntax and semantics that when agreed upon by other participants can represent a way to introduce tokens that can be sent from sender to receiver and confirmed by other participants over a framework. Pchains as it is now is working small scale in a way that you can register and initialize a new private chain and create tx to send to someone else.
