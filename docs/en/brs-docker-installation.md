Introduction
-------------------

The Burst Reference Software can be run with Docker and Docker-Compose. Since Docker supports all major platforms, this can be an easy-to-setup alternative to a platform-dependent installation of the Burst Reference Software.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Database

Currently, Docker images for BRS version 2.3.0 with MariaDB (recommended) or H2 Database are available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/burstappsteam/burstcoin). You have to choose one of them, which is used to store the blockchain.

Configuration

### MariaDB

The following `docker-compose.yml` file can be used to run the BRS with MariaDB database in containers.

    version: '3'

    services:
      burstcoin:
        image: pocconsortium/burstcoin:2.2-mariadb
        restart: always
        depends_on:
         - mariadb
        ports:
         - 8123:8123
         - 8125:8125
      mariadb:
        image: mariadb:10
        environment:
         - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=burst
         - MYSQL_DATABASE=burst
        command: mysqld --character_set_server=utf8mb4
        volumes:
         - ./burst_db:/var/lib/mysql

Save the file and run it.

`docker-compose up -d `

With the `-d` flag, both containers are started as background processes. A `burst_db` folder will be created in the directory of the `docker-compose.yml` file, if it was not created before. This folder is mounted to the MariaDB storage and holds the `burst` database containing the blockchain. The containers can be stopped and removed at any time via `docker-compose down`. With the next start, the `burst_db` folder will be mounted again and your previous blockchain status will be loaded.

### H2

Alternatively, H2 can be used as database to store the blockchain. H2 is an embedded database, therefore one does not have to run it in a separate container. Simply run the following command.

`docker run -p 8123:8123 -p 8125:8125 -v `“`$(pwd)`”`/burst_db:/etc/burstcoin/burst_db -d pocconsortium/burstcoin:2.2-h2 `

“`$(pwd)`”`/burst_db` is the path to the folder which is mounted to the H2 storage. If it does not exist a new `burst_db` folder is created in the current directory.

### Custom configuration

In order to use a custom config - `brs.properties` file, you can simply mount a folder containing the `brs-default.properties` and the `brs.properties` to the `/conf` mount point.

**MariaDB**

    version: '3'

    services:
      burstcoin:
        image: pocconsortium/burstcoin:2.2-mariadb
        restart: always
        depends_on:
         - mariadb
        ports:
         - 8123:8123
         - 8125:8125
        volumes:
         - ./conf:/etc/burstcoin/conf
      mariadb:
        image: mariadb:10
        environment:
         - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=burst
         - MYSQL_DATABASE=burst
        command: mysqld --character_set_server=utf8mb4
        volumes:
         - ./burst_db:/var/lib/mysql

**H2**

`docker run -p 8123:8123 -p 8125:8125 -v `“`$(pwd)`”`/burst_db:/etc/burstcoin/burst_db -v `“`$(pwd)`”`/conf:/etc/burstcoin/conf -d pocconsortium/burstcoin:2.2-h2`
