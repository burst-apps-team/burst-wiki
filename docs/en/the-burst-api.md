Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Burst API allows interaction with Burst nodes using HTTP requests to port 8125. Most HTTP requests can use either the GET or POST methods, but some API calls accept only the POST method for security reasons. Responses are returned as JSON objects.

Each API call is documented below, with definitions given for HTTP request parameters and JSON response fields, followed by an example:

-   The JSON response fields are each followed by one of *S* for string, *A* for array, *O* for object, *N* for number or *B* for boolean.
-   In the examples, the Burst node is represented as *localhost* and requests and responses are formatted for easy reading; line breaks and spaces are not actually used except in some parameter values. All requests are in URL format which implies the HTTP GET method. When GET is allowed, the URL can be entered into a browser URL field but proper URL encoding is usually required (e.g., spaces in a parameter value must be replaced by *+* or *%20*). Otherwise, the URL should be used as a guide to preparing an HTTP POST request using cURL, for example.

All API calls can be viewed and tested on the TestNet at <https://wallet.dev.burst-test.net/test>. For specific API calls, use the GET url <https://wallet.dev.burst-test.net/burst?requestType>=*specificRequestType*.

General Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Genesis Block

Many API requests make reference to the .

### Flexible Account IDs

All API requests that require an account ID accept either an account number or the corresponding [Reed-Solomon address](rs-address-format.md).

### Quantity Units BURST, NQT and QNT

The Burst system has a currency BURST used to quantify value in the system. Like all currencies, BURST circulates in the system, moving from one user to another by payments and purchases. Also, a small fee is required for every transaction, including those in which no BURST is transfered, such as simple messages. This fee goes to the owner of the node that forges (generates) the new block containing the transaction that is accepted onto the blockchain.

Yet internally, the currency is still stored in integer form in units of NQT or NxtQuant, where 1 BURST = 10<sup>8</sup> NQT. All parameters and fields in the API involving a quantity of BURST are denominated in units of NQT, for example *feeNQT*. The only exception is the field *effectiveBalanceNXT*, used in forging calculations.

Other assets can be created within Burst using [Issue Asset](#issue-asset). The issuer must specify the number of decimal places to use in quantifying the asset, and the amount of the asset to create in generic units of QNT or Quant, distinct from NQT. Quantities of assets are stored internally as integers in units of QNT, and assets are priced in NQT per QNT.

| Decimal (BURST) | Canonical Name  | Alternate Name | NQT         |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **1**.00000000  | BURST           | Burst          | 100,000,000 |
| 0.0**1**000000  | cBURST          | Bessie         | 1,000,000   |

| 0.12345678      | digit reference | -              | -           |

### Creating Unsigned Transactions

All API requests that create a new transaction will accept either a *secretPhrase* or a *publicKey* parameter:

-   If *secretPhrase* is supplied, a transaction is created, signed at the server, and broadcast by the server as usual.
-   If only a *publicKey* parameter is supplied as a 64-digit (32-byte) hex string, the transaction will be prepared by the server and returned in the JSON response as *transactionJSON* without a signature. This JSON object along with *secretPhrase* can then be supplied to [Sign Transaction](#sign-transaction) as *unsignedTransactionJSON* and the resulting signed *transactionJSON* can then be supplied to [Broadcast Transaction](#broadcast-transaction). This sequence allows for offline signing of transactions so that *secretPhrase* never needs to be exposed.
-   *unsignedTransactionBytes* may be used instead of unsigned *transactionJSON* when there is no encrypted message. Messages to be encrypted require the *secretPhrase* for encryption and so cannot be included in *unsignedTransactionBytes*.

### Escrow Operations

All API requests that create a new transaction will accept an optional *referencedTransactionFullHash* parameter which creates a chained transaction, meaning that the new transaction cannot be confirmed unless the referenced transaction is also confirmed. This feature allows a simple way of transaction escrow:

-   Alice prepares and signs a transaction A, but doesn't broadcast it by setting the *broadcast* parameter to *false*. She sends to Bob the *unsignedTransactionBytes*, the *fullHash* of the transaction, and the *signatureHash*. All of those are included in the JSON returned by the API request. (Warning: make sure not to send the signed *transactionBytes*, or the *signature* itself, as then Bob can just broadcast transaction A himself).
-   Bob prepares, signs and broadcasts transaction B, setting the *referencedTransactionFullHash* parameter to the *fullHash* of A provided by Alice. He can verify that this hash indeed belongs to the transaction he expects from Alice, by using [Calculate Full Hash](#calculate-full-hash), which takes *unsignedTransactionBytes* and *signatureHash* (both of which Alice has also sent to Bob). He can also use [Parse Transaction](#parse-transaction) to decode the unsigned bytes and inspect all transaction fields.
-   Transaction B is accepted in the unconfirmed transaction pool, but as long as A is still missing, B will not be confirmed, i.e. will not be included in the blockchain. If A is never submitted, B will eventually expire -- so Bob should make sure to set a long enough deadline, such as the maximum of 32767 minutes.
-   Once in the unconfirmed transactions pool, Bob has no way of recalling B back. So now Alice can safely submit her transaction A, by just broadcasting the *signedTransactionBytes* she got in the first step. Transaction A will get included in the blockchain first, and in the next block Bob's transaction B will also be included.

Note that while the above scheme is good enough for a simple escrow, the blockchain does not enforce that if A is included, B will also be included. It may happen due to forks and blockchain reorganization, that B never gets a chance to be included and expires unconfirmed, while A still remains in the blockchain. However, it is not practically possible for Bob to intentionally cause such chain of events and to prevent B from being confirmed.

### Prunable Data

Prunable data can be removed from the blockchain without affecting the integrity of the blockchain. When a transaction containing prunable data is created, only the 32-byte sha256 hash of the prunable data is included in the *transactionBytes*, not the prunable data itself. The non-prunable signed *transactionBytes* are used to verify the signature and to generate the transaction's *fullHash* and ID; when the prunable part of the transaction is removed at a later time, none of these operations are affected.

Prunable data has a predetermined minimum lifetime of two weeks (24 hours on the [Testnet](testnet.md)) from the timestamp of the transaction. Transactions and blocks received from peer nodes are not accepted if prunable data is missing before this time has elapsed. After this time has elapsed, prunable data is no longer included with transactions and blocks transmitted to peer nodes, and is no longer included in the transaction JSON returned by general-purpose API calls such as Get Transaction; the only way to retrieve it, if still available, is through special-purpose API calls such as Get Prunable Message.

Expired prunable data remains stored in the blockchain until removed at the same time derived tables are trimmed, which occurs automatically every 1000 blocks by default.

Prunable data can be preserved on a node beyond the predetermined minimum lifetime by setting the *nxt.maxPrunableLifetime* property to a larger value than two weeks or to *-1* to preserve it indefinitely. To force the node to include such preserved prunable data when transactions and blocks are transmitted to peer nodes, set the *nxt.includeExpiredPrunables* property to *true*, thus making it an archival node.

Currently, there is only one variety of prunable data in the Burst system: prunable [Arbitrary Messages](arbitrary-messages.md). It has a maximum prunable data length of 42 kilobytes.

### Properties Files

The behavior of some API calls is affected by property settings loaded from files in the *brs/conf* directory during Burst server intialization. This directory contains the *brs-default.properties* and *logging-default.properties* files, both of which contain default property settings along with documentation. A few of the property settings can be obtained while the server is running through the [Get Blockchain Status](#get-blockchain) and [Get State](#get-state) calls.

It is recommended not to modify default properties files because they can be overwritten during software updates. Instead, properties in the default files can be overridden by including them in optional *brs.properties* and *logging.properties* files in the same directory. For example, a *brs.properties* file can be created with the content:

`DEV.TestNet = yes`

This causes the Burst server to connect to the [TestNet](testnet.md) instead of the MainNet.
