Introduction
------------

The file `conf/brs-default.properties` is well documented with comments within the file.  Note, however, that the proper way to make changes to it is to **_leave this file AS-IS_** with its defaults and instead create a new file called `conf/brs.properties`.  Use this new file to make any non-default changes to the settings. Both files are read when BRS runs, but settings from `brs.properties` will override settings from the `brs-default.properties` file.

Here is the `brs-default.properties` from version **2.5.0** for reference.
