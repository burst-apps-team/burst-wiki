Introduction
-------

The development of the [PoC Consortium](poc-consortium.md) (PoCC) [mobile wallet](mobile-app.md) for Burst has been announced August, 11th 2017 in the original PoCC announcement on bitcointalk[1]. One month later, a beta-test version has been published[2] and the official released followed by end of September[3]

Features
--------

-   Watch only addresses
-   Currency conversion
-   Client-side encryption and decryption
-   QR code support
-   Secure and easy passphrase generation

I18N - Internationalization
---------------------------

The major part of the wallet localization is done via a .json file containing definitions for text strings used in the wallet. The naming is such, that a 2-letter code denotes the language. en.json is the source file (see below).

If you want to translate this file into some language, you need to translate the “Create New Account”, “Done” etc. not those in ALLCAPS. A major constraint is, that the translated text not only be correct and stylistic, but also of about the same length as the original content. It can be shorter, but not much longer. The 2-letter language code is [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)

### Translation priorities

-   done languages: Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Korean, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil
-   work-in-progress: --
-   wanted languages: Danish, Dutch, Japanese, Portuguese, Romanian and basically everything else
