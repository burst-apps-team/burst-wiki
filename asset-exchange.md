Description
-----------

The Burst Asset Exchange is a built-in peer-to-peer exchange integrated into the Burst Wallet. It allows fast, secure, and decentralized trading of Burst Assets. Because of its decentralized nature, there’s no need for outside organizations or agencies to meddle with its affairs, resulting in improved efficiency and reduced costs.

There’s a wide range of application for potential investments or trades in Asset Exchange due to the fact that Burst Assets can be used as a token for almost anything with value. Examples of such assets include shares in the following: mining pools, retirement funds, crypto mining rigs, crypto gambling sites and silver investments. An overview of the most traded Assets is available [here](http://burstcoin.cc/asset).

Investing
---------

Investing in the Burst asset exchange requires only two things : a Burst wallet and a few burstcoins. The Burst wallet allows direct peer-to-peer trading of assets without any intermediary so fees are almost inexistant.

There are many benefits to owning Asset shares which make it an investment well worth adding to your investment portfolio in the Burst Universe :

### Capital growth

A long term objective of Asset share investment is to take advantage of capital growth. This occurs when an individual experiences significant capital gains from the shares they possess through increases in share prices. Some Assets also issue free or bonus shares to their shareholders as another way of passing on company profits or increases in their net worth.

### Dividends

Ownership in an Asset entitles you to ownership of their net profits. Assets honor this entitlement to their shareholders in the form of dividends. Another dividend approach used by some Assets is to have a portion of its dividends reinvested in the Asset. In this philosophy, additional shares are issued to shareholders, aside from paying out dividends in Burst.

### Liquidity

By their nature, Asset shares are a very liquid product. They can be bought and sold quickly on the Asset Exchange platform. Trading on Asset Exchange also allows you to sell part of your share parcels rather than having to redeem the whole lot.

**Asset Exchange**

This tab gives you access to the Asset Exchange itself. To observe an asset click the “Add asset” button and enter either the Asset ID or ID of the issuing account. Assets of your interest will be listed on the left. By selecting an asset, further information is provided: a description, buy and sell orders, the quantity etc.

**Transfer History**

Here is listed the transfer history of the assets in your possession.

**My Assets**

This page will list all the assets in your possession: both those issued by you and those you bought from the exchange.

**Open Orders**

Here is provided a list of all your orders, notably the assets you are either trying to sell or to buy. It also allows you to cancel them.

**Issue Asset**

A window will pop up allowing you to issue your own assets into the exchange.

**Payout Dividends**

This page allows you to use the Asset Distribution Modules. There are three modules: Dividends, Automatic Asset Distribution, Share Swap.

### Asset Exchange menu

By default, the Asset Exchange does not list any asset. You will have therefore to add the assets (using the Add Asset button) you are interested in, manually, yourself. For this purpose websites that rank the assets in meaningful ways (by volume, by number of trades etc) and that offer specific filters are starting to appear. If you find yourself in the page of an asset, a Bookmark this Asset button will appear that will allow you to keep track of it.

Here are a few lists you can consult to obtain the IDs of the assets. Keep in mind more will appear, so this list is not exhaustive.

-   <http://burstcoin.cc/asset>
-   <https://explore.burst.cryptoguru.org/asset>

**Note**: you can only add assets to the list if you are using the browser in normal mode. If you are in incognito (or equivalent) then any added list will disappear once you close the browser window.

This is the main menu for the Asset Exchange, it is fundamentally organized in two areas.

-   a list with all the assets you are tracking
-   an interface that allows to interact with these assets

If you own tokens for an asset, it will appear in yellow on the side list.

By selecting an asset, the interface area will automatically display the corresponding information. This includes the amount of tokens that have been created (“quantity”), how divisible is the token (“asset decimals”), a brief description of the asset, who created the asset (“account”) and the asset identifier (“asset ID”). These informations are crucial, in fact the asset names are **non-unique**. What this means is that there can be multiple assets that have the same name.

The cost of issuing an asset (1000 BURST) should discourage people from spamming the exchange with assets whose only purpose is confusion and abuse. Without entering this worst-case scenario, it is reasonable to assume that perfectly legit users may create assets of the same name. Therefore a good degree of vigilance before buying is always beneficial.

In order to buy an asset, follow these simple steps:

1.  Select the asset from the list.
2.  Click on “Buy *\*Asset Name\** with BURST”
3.  Quantity: define how many assets you are interested in buying.
4.  Price: set how much you are willing to pay.
    1.  Warnng: “price” refers to the cost of a unit of tokens. So, by entering 10, you are willing to pay 10 BURST per token.
5.  Fee: define the fee, the minimum is 1 BURST.
6.  Press buy.
7.  It will ask you for your passphrase and finally press buy asset.

### My Assets menu

1.  Under ***My Assets***, find the asset you wish to transfer.

3.  Type the recipient
4.  Select the quantity of asset you want to send
5.  Add a message with the transfer if you want.
